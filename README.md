### Software Needed for the Jam Session

If you are participating in the Jam Session, please download both R and RStudio.

- The latest version of R can be obtained from the R Project for Statistical Computing at [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)

After navigating to the website click on “CRAN” under “Download, Packages” on the left-hand side of the welcome screen. You must choose a server in your country of origin, called a CRAN mirror. After doing so, select the appropriate operating system for your computer–Linux, MacOS, or Windows. For Linux and MacOS, follow the directions at the top of the download page. For Windows, download the base package and install it like any other executable file. On Windows machines you might need to have “administrator” privileges to successfully install and use the program.

- The latest version of RStudio can be obtained from [http://www.rstudio.org/](http://www.rstudio.org/)

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. A free application, RStudio combines an intuitive user interface with powerful coding tools to help you get the most out of R.
